# React + Redux CRUD

This is a simple CRUD application for organizing and managing customers/jobs/things you want to keep an eye on.

# Usage

Usage is fairly simple - the majority of the app is navigable by buttons in the UI.

# Weaknesses (for now)

I couldn't quite get the update part of CRUD to function correctly - Some more bugfixing is needed. Also, it could really use some styling!

# How long did it take?

So far, I have about 5 hours invested in this project, as of 2/15/2022, 3:30.
